ichoriumkit.research.dimensionalshard.title=Dimensional Shards
ichoriumkit.research.dimensionalshard.text=Thaumaturges of the Fourth Age spoke of a mythical substance called "Ichor", able to forge some of the most powerful Tools and Armor available to any Thaumaturge who could manage to create it.<BR>I had thought this process was impossible to replicate, until i discovered that whatever Dimensional Shards were being described in the scraps of Research i found seem to still exist. Supposedly, they suddenly stopped coalescing for Thaumaturges late into the Fourth Age, and yet, somehow, they have returned in modern times...<BR>I should gather a sample of these Shards to see if Ichor can be replicated nowadays.
ichoriumkit.research.dimensionalshard.complete.text=The prospect of creating this mythical "Ichor" is promising and seems possible, but i am not sure how i can replicate it as of yet, such will require further Research.<BR>These Dimensional Shards may also have other applications, though there was nothing that the Fourth Age scraps described, Fourth Age Thaumaturges were likely too fixated on Ichor.

ichoriumkit.research.ichor.title=The Lost Substance - Ichor
ichoriumkit.research.ichor.text=I am getting closer to a theoretical means of creating Ichor, but i am not quite there, i must determine what the various fields of Thaumaturgy have to do with Ichor, incase there are important links i am missing, then, i must try my theoretical infusion, and hope for the best.
ichoriumkit.research.ichor.complete.text=It worked! I have sucessfully replicated Ichor! Though it doesn't appear quite the same as in the scraps at first, but can be easily solved by ripping it into chunks. With this substance now in my hands, it is time to push forward to rediscovering this supposedly potent arsenal.

ichoriumkit.research.ichoriumtools.title=Ichorium Tools
ichoriumkit.research.ichoriumtools.text=Thaumaturges of the Fourth Age used an Alloy imbued with Ichor, called "Ichorium" as the basis for their powerful tools, i should create my own sample of this Alloy and investigate how to manipulate it.
ichoriumkit.research.ichoriumtools.complete.text=This Ichorium Alloy is quite simple, in theory, but quite costly to replicate in practice, regardless, Silverwood should be a sufficiently magical material to use as a Handle which conducts the power of Ichorium.<BR>Tools forged from this Alloy are practically undentable, and are very effective too, but is this really all they can offer...?

ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_sword_adv.title=Awakened Ichorium Sword
ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_sword_adv.text=Surely, there must be a way to get more out of these Tools, the scraps describe them as much more interesting than what i have created, perhaps i am missing something, i shall experiment with the Sword i have made.
ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_sword_adv.complete.text=It seems it is possible to empower the Sword, with this new power, it is capable of specialized "Modes" to make combat with many foes much easier.<BR>The default Mode, indicated by the Gems on the tool being Green, will act similar to most Swords. The "Multi" Mode, indicated by the Gems being Red, will harm all creatures near the one that is struck with equal force. The "Shield" Mode, indicated by the Gems being Blue, will reduce the Damage of the sword, but allow it to grant me extra resilience in the form of a Barrier, which can be recharged by striking creatures.

ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_pick_adv.title=Awakened Ichorium Pickaxe
ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_pick_adv.text=Surely, there must be a way to get more out of these Tools, the scraps describe them as much more interesting than what i have created, perhaps i am missing something, i shall experiment with the Pickaxe i have made.
ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_pick_adv.complete.text=It seems it is possible to empower the Pickaxe, with this new power, it is capable of clearing out much more at once when desired, by cycling through the available "Modes" it has.<BR>The default Mode, indicated by the Gems on the tool being Green, will act similar to most Pickaxes. The "Square" Mode, indicated by the Gems being Red, will be able to clear a 5x5 area by simply breaking the central block. And lastly, the "Line" Mode, indicated by the Gems being Blue, will clear out material towards where i mined, useful for creating small tunnels quickly.<BR>It also seems to be even more resilient than ever before, so resilient, it may match the toughness of Bedrock, i wonder what i can find beyond the Bedrock...

ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_axe_adv.title=Awakened Ichorium Axe
ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_axe_adv.text=Surely, there must be a way to get more out of these Tools, the scraps describe them as much more interesting than what i have created, perhaps i am missing something, i shall experiment with the Axe i have made.
ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_axe_adv.complete.text=It seems it is possible to empower the Axe, with this new power, it is capable of clearing out much more at once when desired, by cycling through the available "Modes" it has.<BR>The default Mode, indicated by the Gems on the tool being Green, will act similar to most Axes. The "Square" Mode, indicated by the Gems being Red, will clear out 5x5 areas of material by simply breaking the central block. And lastly, the "Fell" Mode, indicated by the Gems being Blue, will chop entire Trees, and cause their Leaves to decay rapidly.

ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_shovel_adv.title=Awakened Ichorium Shovel
ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_shovel_adv.text=Surely, there must be a way to get more out of these Tools, the scraps describe them as much more interesting than what i have created, perhaps i am missing something, i shall experiment with the Shovel i have made.
ichoriumkit.research.ichorium_shovel_adv.complete.text=It seems it is possible to empower the Shovel, with this new power, it is capable of clearing out much more at once when desired, by cycling through the available "Modes" it has.<BR>The default Mode, indicated by the Gems on the tool being Green, will act similar to most Shovels. The "Square" Mode, indicated by the Gems being Red, will be able to clear a 5x5 area by simply breaking the central block. And lastly, the "Line" Mode, indicated by the Gems being Blue, will clear out material towards where i mined, useful for creating small tunnels quickly.

ichoriumkit.research.ichorarmor.title=Ichorcloth Armor
ichoriumkit.research.ichorarmor.text=Infusing Enchanted Fabric with Ichor seems to be how Fourth Age Thaumaturges created Armor using Ichor. Clever.<BR>Replicating this Cloth myself should be a simple task.
ichoriumkit.research.ichorarmor.complete.text=It is indeed not a difficult process, just a costly one.<BR>It seems that the Enchanted Fabric is enough to support the magical energy of the Ichor, so i won't be needing any extra reagents, besides somes Diamonds to embellish the Fabric with.<BR>The Armor that can be forged out of this cloth is practically unable to be damaged, and offers great defenses, but is this really all it has to offer?

ichoriumkit.research.kamihelm.title=Cowl of the Abyssal Depths
ichoriumkit.research.kamihelm.text=Surely, there must be a way to get more out of this Armor, the scraps describe them as much more interesting than what i have created, perhaps i am missing something, i shall see what i can do with the Cowl.
ichoriumkit.research.kamihelm.complete.text=It seems to be possible to Infuse the Cowl with the aspect of Aqua, granting me the ability to breathe and see underwater, aswell as allowing me to recover my health at a steady pace regardless of how hungry i am.

ichoriumkit.research.kamichest.title=Robes of the Stratosphere
ichoriumkit.research.kamichest.text=Surely, there must be a way to get more out of this Armor, the scraps describe them as much more interesting than what i have created, perhaps i am missing something, i shall see what i can do with the Robes.
ichoriumkit.research.kamichest.complete.text=It seems to be possible to Infuse the Robe with the aspect of Aer, granting the power of Flight.

ichoriumkit.research.kamilegs.title=Leggings of the Mantle
ichoriumkit.research.kamilegs.text=Surely, there must be a way to get more out of this Armor, the scraps describe them as much more interesting than what i have created, perhaps i am missing something, i shall see what i can do with the Legwear.
ichoriumkit.research.kamilegs.complete.text=It seems to be possible to Infuse the Leggings with the aspect of Ignis, granting me immunity to Fire, and drawing on the power of it to help heal my wounds.

ichoriumkit.research.kamiboots.title=Boots of the Horizontal Shield
ichoriumkit.research.kamiboots.text=Surely, there must be a way to get more out of this Armor, the scraps describe them as much more interesting than what i have created, perhaps i am missing something, i shall see what i can do with the Boots.
ichoriumkit.research.kamiboots.complete.text=It seems to be possible to Infuse the Boots with the aspect of Terra, granting me improved speed and jumping, aswell as swifter Mining, and growing Grass atop any Dirt i walk on.

ichoriumkit.research.ichorpouch.title=Ichor Pouch
ichoriumkit.research.ichorpouch.text=The Focus Pouch is quite the amazing creation that I've made thus far, with its incredible utility to hold several foci at once, allowing me to switch my foci with a simple wrench of my wrist, it makes it all the more curious as to why I can't hold regular items inside this marvelous pouch. The best inference I have so far is that the bag is far too fragile with only using mundane leather. Instead of a sturdier material such as Enchanted Fabric, though I suppose fabric isn't the best material for a handbag either...<BR>Something I should research when looking into the creation of the bag is Vacuos. Chests, bags, and perhaps other containers should be looked into as well to see how they work, I should especially study the Ichor substance that I had previously created.
ichoriumkit.research.ichorpouch.complete.text=There we are! With a steady and careful crafting of this "God's Blood" substance, I've learned that Ichor doesn't just enhance normal tools and armor, but perhaps even utilities as well! I've created a bag that holds far more than just mere foci, I can hold tools, weapons, food, blocks... just about anything! A surely unique tool for my toolbelt, with its seemingly bottomless carrying capacity, it seems like this bag can even excel most other backpacks mere men have created without the art of miracle-working in mind! This bag holds a grand total of about 117 slots worth of items, and each can carry 64 of any stackable item within each of its slots. It also functions perfectly as a Focus Pouch too, so there's no need to make another Focus Pouch in conjunction, though it may be advantageous to make multiple of these pouches to extend my carrying capacity within my inventory.

ichoriumkit.research.blackhole_ring.title=Black Hole Ring
ichoriumkit.research.blackhole_ring.text=[WIP]
ichoriumkit.research.blackhole_ring.complete.text=[WIP] This ring can be set to condense any block, by right clicking with it in world in the type of block you want to have it be set to, when enabled via right click will absorb any excess (over 1 stack) of that block in your inventory, and make sure at least one stack stays there. The contents can be stored in any inventory by right clicking it, or placed in world as if they were normal blocks.<BR><BR>It can store over 2 billion of the same block. Guess cobblestone clogging the space isn't an issue. If the ring is empty, it can be shift right clicked into another block to change its binding.

ichoriumkit.research.proto_clay.title=Proto Clay
ichoriumkit.research.proto_clay.text=[WIP]
ichoriumkit.research.proto_clay.complete.text=[WIP] You grew tired of having to constantly swap your tools.<BR><BR>This mixture will, by melding with the Ichorium, switch any Awakened Ichorium tools being held by the one used for the block being pointed at, case one tries to break it with the wrong tool.<BR><BR>As an example, trying to break a dirt block with an Awakened Ichorium Pickaxe while a Shovel is present elsewhere in the inventory will swap the two, and allow for fast disposal of the dirt block.
